After experimenting with WebSockets and mobile devices I ended up with several versions of WebSockets.


PLAY FRAMEWORK with SCALA

This is a simple program using scala and the Play Framework using WebSockets to echo back anything you send to the program. Tested on Play Framework version 2.2.0.

If you got here from doing a Google search for Enumerator.imperative[String] it has been deprecated and replaced with:  val (out,channel) = Concurrent.broadcast[String]


HEROKU Errors

If you get heroku error 501: not supported then add WebSockets to Heroku. This is an experiemtal command  not offically released by Heroku but this command worked on Dec, 23, 2013.
In heroku type the command: heroku labs:enable websockets -a the-heroku-application-name   


WEBSOCKET CLIENTS

You can test the following WebSocket clients by modifying the code to connect to: http://www.websocket.org/echo.html or to wherever you deployed the Play WebSockets example.

   HTML5 Websockets

   Appgyver Mobile WebSocket

   Game Closure WebSocket test

The Play Framwork 2.2.0 scala program will echo back anything you send to it.
