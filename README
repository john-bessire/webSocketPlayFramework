After experimenting with WebSockets and mobile devices I ended up with several versions of WebSockets.

If you got here from doing a Google search for Enumerator.imperative[String] it has been deprecated and replaced with:  val (out,channel) = Concurrent.broadcast[String]


You can test the following WebSocket clients by modifying the code to connect to: http://www.websocket.org/echo.html

   HTML5 Websockets

   Appgyver Mobile WebSocket
      https://github.com/john-bessire/appGyverWebSockets

   Game Closure WebSocket test
      GameClosure - https://github.com/john-bessire/gameClosureWebSockets


The Play Framwork 2.2.0 scala program will echo back anything you send to it.
